Part of excelling at machine learning is knowing when you're dealing with a machine learning problem in the first place. Machine learning is more than simply computing averages or performing some data manipulation. It actually involves making predictions about observations based on previous information.

Which of the following statements uses a machine learning model?

(1) Determine whether an incoming email is spam or not. (2) Obtain the name of last year's Giro d'Italia champion. (3) Automatically tagging your new Facebook photos. (4) Select the student with the highest grade on a statistics course.
A: 1 & 3
