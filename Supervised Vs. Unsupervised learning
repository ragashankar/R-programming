Supervised learning - Used to assign class or varaibles to unseen observations, given a set of labeled observations.
Eg: classification, regression

Unsupervised learning - Does not require specific labeled obs
Eg: clustering

Performance of model :

Supervised Learning - Compare real labels with predicted labels, predictions should be similar to real labels

Unsupervised Learning - No real labels to compare.


Semi supervised learning:
1. A lot of unlabeled obs
2. A few labled
3. Group similar obs using clustering
4. use clustering info and classes of unlabelled obs  to assign a class to unlabelled observations.
5. More labled obs for supervised learning
