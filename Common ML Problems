Classification
Regression
Clustering

Classification: Predicts whetehr a given obs belongs to certain category
 Earlier obs - > Estimate - > classifier ( Earlier obs can be estimated by classifier)
 Classifier - > Unseen data -> class ( Classifier labels unseen data with a class)
 
 Applications:
 1. Animal recognition
 2. Medical Diagnosis
 3. Foetus gender recognition
 
 Importatnt: 
 Qualitative Output
 Predefined Classes
 
 Example: Animal Recognition - Suppose, I come across an animal whuch has two long ears, long mouth and brays loudly, I analyse it and create a class called Donkey under which I put this data. After sometime, if i come across similar kind of recognition for an animal, I dont have to analyse it again, i can directly classify it under donkey based on my early observations through classifier. This is called
 classification.

 Regression: Predict continous or for i/p based on prev values. The i/p var are called predictors and the o/p var are called response
 Reg is similar to classification where we estimate a function that maps i/p to o/p based on early obs.
 
 Difference b/w classification and regression is that we estimate val in reg and not based on class obs as in classification
 
 Example: For a given data set that contains height and weight of the people, we can find thro regression that:
 Is the Relationships between Height and weight?
 Is it Linear?
 Can we predict weight based on height?
 
 Its like fitting a linear function : Height = (b0 + b1) * Weight , where b0 and b1 are the parameters/ modular coefficients
 Solving ML problem based on finding good values for b0 and b1.
 
 lm(response ~ predictors)
 
 Uses: (Reg is based on values and not just class)
 Predicitng about landing job based on Grades.
 Predciting Credit scores based on payments
 
 Important:
 Quantitative Output
 Previous input - output obs.

 Clustering:
 Grouping of objs that are similar within cluster
 Dissimilar between clusters
 
 1. No labels
 
 2. No right or wrong
 
 3. Plenty possible clustering
 
 k-means : Cluster data in k clusters based on some similarity measure
