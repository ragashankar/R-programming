 Earlier obs - > Estimate - > classifier ( Earlier obs can be estimated by classifier)
 Classifier - > Unseen data -> class ( Classifier labels unseen data with a class)
 
 Applications:
 1. Animal recognition
 2. Medical Diagnosis
 3. Foetus gender recognition
 
 Importatnt: 
 Qualitative Output
 Predefined Classes

 Regression: Predict continous or for i/p based on prev values. The i/p var are called predictors and the o/p var are called response
 Reg is similar to classification where we estimate a function that maps i/p to o/p based on early obs.
 
 Difference b/w classification and regression is that we estimate val in reg and not based on class obs as in classification
