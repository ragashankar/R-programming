# How many grades in your class are higher than 75?

Assign to n_smart the number of grades in my_class that are greater than or equal to 80.
Write an if statement that prints out "smart class" if n_smart is greater than 50.
Extend the if statement with an else clause that prints out "rather average"

# me, my_class and last_5 are preloaded

# Define n_smart
n_smart <- sum(my_class >= 80)

# Code the if-else construct
if(n_smart > 50){
    print("smart class")
} else{
    print("rather average")
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assign to prop_less the proportion of students whose grade - stored in my_class - was lower than yours.
Write a control construct with the following properties:
if prop_less exceeds 0.9, print out "you're among the best 10 percent".
if the above is not the case, but prop_less exceeds 0.8, print out "you're among the best 20 percent".
if the above two don't hold, print out "need more analysis".

# me, my_class and last_5 are preloaded

# Define prop_less
prop_less <- mean(my_class < me)

# Code the control construct
if(prop_less > 0.9){
    print("you're among the best 10 percent")
} else if(prop_less > 0.8) {
    print("you're among the best 20 percent")
} else{
    print("need more analysis")
}

# me, my_class and last_5 are preloaded

# Embedded control structure: fix the error
if (mean(my_class) < 75) {
  if (mean(my_class) > me) {
    print("average year, but still smarter than me")
  } else {
    print("average year, but I'm not that bad")
  }} else {
  if (mean(my_class) > me) {
    print("smart year, even smarter than me")
  } else {
    print("smart year, but I am smarter")
  }
}
