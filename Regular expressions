?regex - documentation on regu exp.

Details: A ‘regular expression’ is a pattern that describes a set of strings. Two types of regular expressions are used in R, extended regular expressions (the default) and Perl-like regular expressions used by perl = TRUE. There is a also fixed = TRUE which can be considered to use a literal regular expression.

Other functions which use regular expressions (often via the use of grep) include apropos, browseEnv, help.search, list.files and ls. These will all use extended regular expressions.

Patterns are described here as they would be printed by cat: (do remember that backslashes need to be doubled when entering R character strings, e.g. from the keyboard).

Long regular expressions may or may not be accepted: the POSIX standard only requires up to 256 bytes.

grep() : Returns indices/posistion of the char in the vector.

GOT <- c("starks","Targy","lannis","baratheon","wildlings","camerons")

grep(pattern = "l",x=GOT) # gives the position of chars which contains "l"

grep(pattern = "^s",x=GOT) # Gives the pos of chars which starts with "s"

grep(pattern = "s$",GOT) # Gives the pos of chars which ends with "s"

grep("^t",GOT,ignore.case = T) # Ignore the upper/lower case and returns the result

grep("a",GOT,invert=T) # Gives the pos of chars which does not contain "a"

grep("n",GOT,value = T) # Gives the characters

grep("n",GOT,fixed=T) # Gives the pos of chars with exact matching

grepl() :

Sames as grep() but returns logical.
