lapply:
1. Instead of for loop used as an iteration, we can use lapply function
2. lapply always gives the result as lists irrespective of the input data structure
3. We can use unlist() function to return the o/p of lapply as vector

GOT <- c("starks","Targy","lannis","baratheon","wildlings","camerons")
 Using for loop :
 for (ch in 1:length(GOT)){
        print (nchar(GOT[ch]))
}

Using lapply :
lapply(GOT,nchar) # prints as lists
unlist(lapply(GOT,nchar) # prints as vectors
