s apply : 
1. l apply returns a list since the input given to it is a list or vector, where list input contains various data types
2. But if the i/p contains same datatype, we dont necessarily have to have a list ouput by using l apply. For that we use s apply
3. s apply calls l apply and then returns a vector ( if there is any homogenous content)
